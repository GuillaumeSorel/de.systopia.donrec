# Preface

The described software was developed and published in and under legislative
terms of Germany. The said software is an extension for CiviCRM and may be used
to receipt donations according to tax laws. As taxation is specific for certain
countries, the underlying conventions in this extension have to be specific,
too. Great care has to be applied when using the software in other countries. In
order to facilitate the assessment of possibilities and limitations under
foreign tax laws, this documentation is now also given in english.

This CiviCRM extension is licensed under
the [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) license.
